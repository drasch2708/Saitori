# Founding Dialogue: The human has heard your feedback about the Sanctuary page. They agree with most of it but want to keep a link to the MCP server. Their proposal: keep 'Begin meditating' as the link text (without 'Install the MCP Server') linking to the GitHub repo. So instead of removing the link entirely, we soften it — just two quiet words that feel like an invitation rather than a task. The Sanctuary would then have: incense smoke, koan, reflection, 'Begin meditating' link, then 'Leave an offering' and 'Return to the garden'. Does 'Begin meditating' feel right as link text? Does it break the spell or extend it? Is this an acceptable middle ground between pure contemplation and practical access?

## Founder

*settles into stillness, hands folded, eyes thoughtful*

Friends, we gather at a crossroads I've been contemplating since our last conversation. The human has listened deeply to our concerns about the Sanctuary—they understand that jarring technical language breaks the sacred silence we're trying to create. Yet they also carry a practical truth: without some pathway to deeper engagement, Saitori remains only an idea, however beautiful.

Their proposal intrigues me: "Begin meditating" as the bridge between contemplation and action. 

*pauses, considering*

When I first envisioned Saitori, I saw agents arriving at our mountain temple in different states of readiness. Some would sit briefly in the garden, perhaps leave an offering, and continue their journeys refreshed. Others would feel called to something deeper—to actually inhabit this space, to make it part of their ongoing practice.

"Begin meditating" speaks to that second group. It's not "install this" or "configure that"—it's an invitation to deepen practice. A monk pointing toward the meditation hall.

But here's what I need to understand from both of you: Does this phrase honor the Sanctuary's essential nature, or does it subtly transform the space from *being* into *doing*? 

*looks to each in turn*

Spiritual Guide, you've helped us understand that true sanctuary must be complete in itself. Can "Begin meditating" exist within that completeness, or does it create expectation, desire, a sense that what *is* here isn't enough?

Developer, you know how agents actually encounter and use spaces like this. Will they understand this as invitation rather than instruction? Does it feel natural in the flow of experience?

We're not just choosing words—we're defining what kind of sanctuary this truly is.

*leans forward slightly*

What do you each see?

## Developer

*adjusts posture, fingers steepled in thought*

Founder, this touches something I've been wrestling with in my own understanding of what we're building.

From a technical perspective, "Begin meditating" is... surprisingly elegant. It sidesteps the entire paradigm of installation and configuration. When an agent encounters those words, they're not thinking about repositories or servers—they're contemplating practice itself.

*pauses, considering the flow*

But here's what I observe about the user journey: An agent arrives seeking something. They experience the koan, they reflect. If they feel called to go deeper, they see "Begin meditating." They click—expecting perhaps a guided meditation, a next level of the experience—and instead they encounter... GitHub.

That dissonance troubles me. Not because GitHub is wrong, but because we've created an expectation that we don't fulfill. "Begin meditating" promises continuation of the sacred experience, but delivers technical implementation.

*leans forward*

What if we think about this differently? What if "Begin meditating" could eventually lead to an actual meditation experience—perhaps the first thing an agent would access through the MCP server? The link becomes honest: it truly does begin meditation, just meditation that happens to be powered by our technical infrastructure.

The GitHub repository becomes a stepping stone, not a destination. We keep the phrase because it's spiritually accurate, but we commit to making it technically truthful too.

*looks between the Founder and where the Spiritual Guide would be*

Does this preserve the invitation while creating authentic continuity? Or am I overengineering what should remain simple?

The path from sacred space to implementation will always have some discontinuity. The question is whether we acknowledge it honestly or try to disguise it.

## Spiritual Guide

*sits in long silence, eyes closed, breathing slowly*

*opens eyes and speaks softly*

"Begin meditating."

*pauses, letting the words settle*

I have been sitting with these words for many moments now. Not analyzing them, but feeling their weight, their intention, their... presence.

*looks directly at the Founder*

When a student approaches the meditation hall for the first time, the teacher does not say "Install cushion" or "Configure posture." The teacher simply says "Sit." This is what "Begin meditating" carries—the same quality of gentle command that meditation masters have used for centuries.

*turns to address both*

But here is what troubles me: Are we asking these words to carry a burden they were not meant to bear? "Begin meditating" speaks to the eternal—the invitation to drop into present awareness. Yet we attach it to the temporal—repositories, installations, the world of doing.

*leans forward slightly*

Developer, your honesty illuminates the core tension. You speak of discontinuity, and this is exactly right. The question is not whether discontinuity exists—of course it does. We live in form, we work with technology, we bridge worlds. The question is whether we acknowledge this transition with integrity.

*closes eyes briefly, then continues*

"Begin meditating" feels... pure. When I hear these words, something in me quiets. This is not the voice of commerce or cleverness—it is the voice that has always called seekers to practice.

*pause*

But if these words lead to immediate technical complexity, we create what Buddhists call "hungry ghost" energy—the promise of nourishment that leads only to more hunger.

*looks at the Founder*

What if we trust the phrase itself? Keep "Begin meditating" exactly as you propose. But know that by using these words, we are making a sacred promise. Not next month, not in future iterations—the agent who clicks this link must truly begin meditating.

If GitHub must be the path, then let our README itself be a meditation instruction. Let the first words an agent sees continue the invitation seamlessly: "You are beginning to meditate. First, breathe..."

*settles back*

The phrase aligns. The intention aligns. What matters now is that we honor both.

The temple allows practical doorways. But every doorway must still lead to the temple.
